### How to Run the Code

Clone the repository. Run the Jupyter Notebook with the name `Sliding Window.ipynb`. The notebook automatically loads the required scripts in the first cell. Run all the cells of the notebook. The last cell will produce the output of the small window that was sent to the Optical Flow algorithm for every new frame in the video. In the end, `mklharris.py` was used to generate the images containing green arrow to represent the computed direction of motion.
